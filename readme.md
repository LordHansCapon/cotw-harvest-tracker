# theHunter: Call of the Wild Stat Viewer
## Introduction
Expansive Worlds' theHunter: Call of the Wild contains a lackluster implementation of stat tracking in-game. This drove me nuts so I made a simple program that keeps track of my harvests (you can find it [here](https://github.com/LordHansCapon/cotw-stat-trak)) and a viewer program that allows me to easily view my harvests.

The stat trak project generates a save file which contains all the harvests per animal while this project is aimed to give a simple user interface to view our stats. Simple as that.

### Reserves
Home screen, all the reserves are listed.

### Animals
Animals are listed per class in every reserve.

### Harvests
Harvests are displayed per animal in a table which can be sorted by any column.

## Installation
No installation is needed, the program is compiled into a single executable with some asset files. Download the latest build, extract it and start the program.

[theHunter: Call of the Wild Stat Trak](https://github.com/LordHansCapon/cotw-stat-trak) is needed to start tracking your harvests! This program only allows the viewing of your harvests and it does not track your harvests!

## Usage
Once you have your `statistics.sav` file generated by the [theHunter: Call of the Wild Stat Trak](https://github.com/LordHansCapon/cotw-stat-trak), **copy** your `statistics.sav` into the same folder as this project's exe to view it!
