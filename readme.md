# theHunter: Call of the Wild Harvest Viewer
## Introduction
Expansive Worlds' theHunter: Call of the Wild contains a lackluster implementation of harvest tracking in-game. This drove me nuts so I made a simple program that keeps track of my harvests (CotW Harvest Tracker) and a viewer program (CotW Harvest Viewer) that allows me to easily view my harvests.

The Harvest Tracker generates a save file which contains all the harvests per animal while the Harvest Viewer is aimed to give a simple user interface to view our harvests. Simple as that.

### Reserves
Home screen, all the reserves are listed.

### Animals
Animals are listed per class in every reserve.

### Harvests
Harvests are displayed per animal in a table which can be sorted by any column.

### Latest harvests
Latest harvests can be viewed in the Latest screen which is accessible from the Reserves screen.

## Installation
No installation is needed, the program is compiled into a single executable with some asset files. Download the latest build, extract it and start the program.

## Usage
Start Expansive Worlds' **theHunter: Call of the Wild** then start the CotW Harvest Tracker executable. A console window will pop up which needs a little bit of time to finish initialization. Once it is complete a message will be displayed: `"- All is good, we are checking your harvest every second -"`

Once you have your `harvests.sav` file generated by the Harvest Tracker, open the Harvest Viewer to view your harvests.

## Disclaimer
The Harvest Tracker program does not modify your game at all, it merely reads your PC's memory. This does **NOT** violate EULA! You **should not** be banned as there is no way to detect this, however I take no responsibility if otherwise you get banned!
