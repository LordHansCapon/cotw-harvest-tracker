# theHunter: Call of the Wild Harvest Tracker
## Introduction
Expansive Worlds' theHunter: Call of the Wild contains a lackluster implementation of harvest tracking in-game. This drove me nuts so I made a simple program that keeps track of my harvests (CotW Harvest Tracker) and a viewer program (CotW Harvest Viewer) that allows me to easily view my harvests.

The Harvest Tracker generates a save file which contains all the harvests per animal while the Harvest Viewer is aimed to give a simple user interface to view our harvests. Simple as that.

## Requirements
- This software has only been tested on Windows 10 x64 with the Steam ENGLISH version of CotW. Other versions may not work.
- **ONLY ENGLISH IS SUPPORTED, OTHER LANGUAGES CRASH THE SOFTWARE**

## Key Features

### Reserves
Home screen, all the reserves are listed.

### Animals
Animals are listed per class in every reserve.

Animals have their harvest counts displayed along with a diamond badge if you have harvested at least one diamond of the species.

### Harvests
Harvests are displayed per animal in a table which can be sorted by any column.

Badge counts are recorded along with harvests since last diamond and harvests took for last diamond stats.

### Latest harvests
Latest harvests can be viewed in the Latest screen which is accessible from the Reserves screen.

## Installation
No installation is needed, the program is compiled into a single executable with some asset files. Download the latest build, extract it and start the program.

## Usage
Start Expansive Worlds' **theHunter: Call of the Wild** then start the CotW Harvest Tracker executable. A console window will pop up which needs a little bit of time to finish initialization. Once it is complete the console will ask for a YES or NO input regarding your latest harvest (useful if you forgot to start the program before you harvested your last animal). Then a message will be displayed when it is ready to record: `"- All is good, we are checking your harvest every second -"`

Once you have your `harvests.sav` file generated by the Harvest Tracker, open the Harvest Viewer to view your harvests.

## Build
Build your own executables with Python!
- Download the source code.
- Run `pip install .` in `src\cotw-harvest-viewer` AND `src\cotw-harvest-tracker`.
- Run the `build.py` script in both `src\cotw-harvest-viewer` AND `src\cotw-harvest-tracker` directories. Make sure to open the terminal in that directory.
- Built executables can be found in the root dist folder.
- Copy the `src\cotw-harvest-viewer\assets` and place it inside the dist folder.
- We are done!

## Known Issues
As any software, this software also has flaws.
- There is rare bug where the recording of animals would stop but no error is displayed.

## Note
This is my first python project and is meant to be a monorepo. The code quality is subpar because it was cobbled together quickly, however if you have suggestions regarding monorepo management with proper package management, feel free to submit an issue about it!

## Disclaimer
The Harvest Tracker program does not modify your game at all, it merely reads your PC's memory. This does **NOT** violate EULA! You **should not** be banned as there is no way to detect this, however I take no responsibility if otherwise you get banned!
